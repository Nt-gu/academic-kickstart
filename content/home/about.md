# Biography

I am a Researcher at the University of Gothenburg. I work at a Language Technology Research Lab, Spr√•kbanken, 
and for the Centre for Digital Humanities. My research focuses on computational methods for detecting changes in 
natural language, in particular semantic changes and lexical replacements. 
I also work in sentiment mining for Swedish, and text mining for the digital humanities. 

Recently, I have started to think about how we can apply data science methods to the humanities to 
generate sustainable and representative knowledge.
